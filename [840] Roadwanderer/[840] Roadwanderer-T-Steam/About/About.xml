	<description>Chinese to English translation of @RedFox_2020's "Roadwanderer" SWB. I apologize for any mistranslations as I do not speak Chinese. 
	Big thanks to the original author for allowing me to do a translation for their awesome mod. I hope you guys enjoy their mod as much as I have.
		
	If the original author wishes at any time for me to remove this from the workshop, I will comply with their request to do so.
