		<Roadwanderer.description>An SUV version of the Roadrunner, the Roadwanderer comes equipped with a shorter wheelbase and a more compact size, while still retaining all the performance of the original pickup truck. Although the rear passengers now have to share their leg-room with any loaded cargo, it beats having to walk. \n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Crew:&lt;/color&gt; Driver x1, Passenger x2\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Power:&lt;/color&gt; Chemfuel</Roadwanderer.description>
